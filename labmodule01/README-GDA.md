# Gateway Device Application (Connected Devices)

## Lab Module 01

Be sure to implement all the PIOT-GDA-* issues (requirements) listed at [PIOT-INF-01-001 - Lab Module 01](https://github.com/orgs/programming-the-iot/projects/1#column-9974937).

### Description

NOTE: Include two full paragraphs describing your implementation approach by answering the questions listed below.

What does your implementation do? 

The implementation for the GDA device creates another testing environment, but in this case it is used in Java.
That being said, JUnit testing is used within this scope in the Eclipse IDE for the GDA device. 

How does your implementation work?

Using the provided files from the github repository, we downloaded them through the set up process of our 
environment and utilized them to ensure the environements testing capabilities are authentic. The environement
ran through the maven installation to validate this and finally was pushed back into the github repository.

NOTE: Be sure to include the branch (e.g. https://github.com/programming-the-iot/python-components/tree/alpha001).

### UML Design Diagram(s)

NOTE: Include one or more UML designs representing your solution. It's expected each
diagram you provide will look similar to, but not the same as, its counterpart in the
book [Programming the IoT](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-the-internet/9781492081401/).

### Unit Tests Executed

NOTE: TA's will execute your unit tests. You only need to list each test case below
(e.g. ConfigUtilTest, DataUtilTest, etc). Be sure to include all previous tests, too,
since you need to ensure you haven't introduced regressions.

ConfigUtilTest:

### Integration Tests Executed

NOTE: TA's will execute most of your integration tests using their own environment, with
some exceptions (such as your cloud connectivity tests). In such cases, they'll review
your code to ensure it's correct. As for the tests you execute, you only need to list each
test case below (e.g. SensorSimAdapterManagerTest, DeviceDataManagerTest, etc.)
